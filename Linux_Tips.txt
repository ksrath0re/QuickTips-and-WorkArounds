1. Recursively count files in a Linux directory

find DIR_NAME -type f | wc -l

Explanation:

   - -type f to include only files.
   - | (and not Â¦) redirects find command's standard output to wc command's standard input.
   - wc (short for word count) counts newlines, words and bytes on its input (docs).
   - -l to count just newlines.
